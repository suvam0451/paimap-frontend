Since the patches keep adding new weapons and such, these scripts help us verify our available data with other sources

### How to parse the drop-rate data from the Data Gathering team

Copy both the rows like this (Can't select individual grids in google sheets for some reason)

Open a .txt file and paste the content. Every alternate line would have a single number (like shown)

Delete those and keep the other lines. We are done here

- The amount of spaces/tabs does not matter
- the gaps at start don't matter. No need to prettify further

```shell
# Now run (Nothing outisde of standard python install needed)
genshindata_bossparse.py {filename}.py
```
